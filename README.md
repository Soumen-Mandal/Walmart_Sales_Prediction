1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Pre-processing
4. Data Manipulation
5. Feature Selection/Extraction
6. Predictive Modelling
7. Project Outcomes & Conclusion


Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:

1. The Dataset was quiet small with just 6435 samples & after preprocessing 7.5% of the datasamples were dropped.
2. Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the feature-set.
3. The features had high multicollinearity, hence in Feature Extraction step, we shortlisted the appropriate features with RFE Technique.
4. Testing multiple algorithms with default hyperparamters gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.
5. It is safe to use ridge regression algorithm performed better than other algorithms, as their scores were quiet comparable & also they're more generalisable.
